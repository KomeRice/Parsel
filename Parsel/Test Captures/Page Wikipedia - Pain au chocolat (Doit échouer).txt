'''Pain au chocolat''' ({{IPA-fr|pɛ̃ o ʃɔkɔla|-|Fr-pain au chocolat.ogg}}, literally "chocolate bread"), also known as '''chocolatine''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɔkɔlatin|pron|Fr-Paris--chocolatine.ogg}}) in the south-west part of France and in [[Quebec]], is a type of [[viennoiserie]] [[sweet roll]] consisting of a [[cuboid]]-shaped piece of [[Baker's yeast|yeast]]-[[Leaven|leavened]] [[laminated dough]], similar in texture to a [[puff pastry]], with one or two pieces of [[dark chocolate]] in the centre...

Pain au chocolat is made of the same layered doughs as a [[croissant]]. Often sold still hot or warm from the oven, they are commonly sold alongside [[croissants]] in [[Pâtisserie|French bakeries]] and [[Supermarket|supermarkets]].

==Origins and history==
Legend has it that [[Marie-Antoinette d'Autriche|Marie-Antoinette]] introduced the croissant to France, but croissants and pains au chocolat are a relatively modern invention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1-800-bakery.com/newsdesk/History_of_the_Croissant.html|title=History of the Croissant|date=16 April 2013|website=1-800-Bakery.com|accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref> The word croissant,  which refers to a plain form of pain au chocolat shaped like a half-moon or "crescent", made its entry in the French dictionary in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.doctissimo.fr/debrouillandise/histoire-702096/viennent-sacrosaints-croissants-23492041.html|title=D'ou viennent les sacrosaints Croissants et Pains au Chocolat?|publisher=Club Doctissimo|language=French|accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref> The type of pastry, called ''[[viennoiserie]]'' in French, was introduced in the early 19th century, when August Zang, an [[Austria]]n officer, and Ernest Schwarzer, an Austrian aristocrat, founded a [[Vienna|Viennese]] bakery in Paris located at 92, [[rue de Richelieu]].

Originally, croissants and pains au chocolat were made from a [[brioche]] base but later evolved to incorporate a buttery flaky dough (''[[pâte feuilletée]]'').
